# RF_Light_Control

RF control code to switch Tinytuya smart lights.

This repo is to recyle bunch of old RF 433/315MHz switches to use with my RPI to control smart lights (lg1) with (rfmod1).
Thanks to https://github.com/konsumer/lighthelp help I have maneged to created a few diffrent versions 
https://github.com/Electrik-rich546456/RF_RPI_Python_Light_Switch

I made it turn the lights on and off from specific RF button code and ignore long press and rolling press for now.

Apologies if this is a little hard to read I dont know how to embed links on here.

Feel free to improve on it :-)

Thanks to @konsumer for all your help :-)
